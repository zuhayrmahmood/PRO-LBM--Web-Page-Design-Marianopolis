        <h2>What I like about Basketball</h2>
        <p>Basketball is one of my favourite sports. I really like the team aspect of basketball. <br> Everyone is constantly involved and it is the perfect mix of brains and athleticism. <br> There are also many different oppurtunities for spectacular 200IQ plays to be made.</p>

        <h2>How I feel playing Basketball</h2>
        <p>It has been a long time since I've played basketball. But back in my hayday I was the <b style="color: red;">MVP</b> of our team during high school. <br> Before COVID, I also played at Marianopolis. I am always ina  blissful state while playing. It taked my mind off of the trying times of life.</p>
        
        <h2>How I started liking Basketball</h2>
        <p>Originally, I was not a fan of Basketball at all. I started playign when I was 6 but kept on playing. I only started enjoying Basketball once I grew during my teen years. <br> Basketball is an extremely appealing sport, many people enjoy it and it is one of the top grossing sports in the world. <br> Hopefully I can play once again with my friends (one of the reasons why I played) soon enough thanks to COVID. </p>
