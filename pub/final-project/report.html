        <h1>Visual Studio Code Report</h1>
        <h3>By Araaf and Zuhayr, Web Page Design Final Project, May 2nd 2021</h3>

        <br>

        <h5>Work Description</h5>
        <p>The two pages picked were the Web Tic Tac Toe and the Non-Latin alphabet page. The language picked was Arabic, done by Zuhayr with <br>
            tic tac toe being done by Araaf. The editor we picked was Visual Studio Code from Microsoft. We picked this because it worked on both Mac <br>
            and Windows. Araaf is on Mac while I'm on Windows 10. It is also lightweight and easy to use.
        </p>

        <h5>Meaningful Snapshots</h5>
        <p>Here you can find some snapshots of the editor and the arabic page!</p>

        <p>The editor we picked was Visual Studio Code from Microsoft. It is a lightweight IDE used for many programming languages but also HTML and CSS. <br>
        To start using the editor first you must install it from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">here.</a> This link will take you to the installation <br>
        site where you can select the appropriate operating system you have. 
        </p>

        <h6>b. </h6>
        <p>
            There were many helpful, user efficient features. First off, the one I liked the most was the colour coding of the HTML code. This helps organize the code and <br>
            makes it much more pleasant to look at from a developper's point of view. Another useful feature was the auto completion. Whenever typing a tag, the auto complete would <br>
            fill the rest of the tag if it wasn't a oneshot tag. Also, if you press CTRL + ALT and then use arrow keys, you can write multiple lines at once, increasing productivity. <br>
            Lastly, while this isn't exclusive to just VSC, you could use CTRL + arrows to travel between words or sentences with Home and End instead of arrows, to select the travelled distance, <br>
            hold shift while travelling! 
        </p>

        <h6>c. </h6>
        <p>To be honest, there isn't much that needs to be improved in my opinion. A lot of the features are fairly beginner friendly. One thing I found confusing were the options <br>
        for programming, the run and debug features weren't all too useful for me since we aren't programming, so I would stay away from those.
